/**  
 * Provides a public static method generateTwinPrime(int min, int max) that generates a value 
 * for the HashTable table size m in the range of [min:max]. A good table size is a 
 * twin prime m that is 2 away from another prime (such that m and m − 2 are primes).  
 * Two primes that differ by two are called “twin primes.”  The method to generate twin primes 
 * should find the smallest set of twin primes both in the given range and then return the 
 * larger of the two. 
 * The HashtableExperiment class will call generateTwinPrime(95500, 96000) to get an appropriate 
 * twin prime for the experiment. This allows us to all use the same table size and be able to 
 * compare some of the results.
